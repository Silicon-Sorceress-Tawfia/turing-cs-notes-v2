Turing CS Notes
Turing CS Notes is a curated resource hub for computer science students, specifically designed to support students from National University in Bangladesh. This website provides a semester-based structure where students can explore subjects in a streamlined, organized way.

Project Overview
This project includes a main page linking to individual semester pages, each displaying the subjects covered in that semester. Semester VIII is marked as "Coming Soon" as its content is under development. The project is built using HTML and CSS and is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

index.html: The main landing page with clickable boxes for each semester (I to VIII).
semester1.html to semester7.html: Individual pages for each semester, displaying subjects as clickable boxes.
semester8.html: A "Coming Soon" page for Semester VIII, indicating that content is still in progress.
styles.css: Shared CSS file for consistent styling across all pages, including dark mode support.
Features
